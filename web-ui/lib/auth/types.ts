/**
 * Auth types shared by the application.
 *
 * This module provides thin, well‑documented TypeScript types that extend the
 * upstream NextAuth/`@auth/core` types with application specific fields. The
 * primary extension is adding an optional `account_id` to the user object which
 * our credentials provider sets for convenience and downstream services.
 *
 * Exported types:
 * - `NextAuthUserWithAccountId` — a `NextAuthUser` with optional `account_id`
 * - `SessionWithAccountId` — the standard `Session` with the extended user type
 */

/**
 * Represents an authenticated user with an optional numeric `account_id`.
 *
 * Background:
 * - `NextAuthUser` is provided by the `next-auth` types and models the standard
 *   user properties (id, name, email, image, etc.). Our local credential provider
 *   includes `account_id` (a numeric ID used by our backend) on the returned
 *   user object. This type documents that extension so the rest of the codebase
 *   can access `account_id` safely.
 *
 * Fields:
 * - All fields from `NextAuthUser` are available.
 * - `account_id?: number` — optional numeric identifier correlating to the
 *   application's account record. Marked optional because not all auth flows
 *   populate it (for example, third‑party providers may omit it).

/**
 * Session shape used across the application that includes the extended user type.
 *
 * This type augments the `Session` exported by `@auth/core/types` to indicate
 * that `session.user` (when present) may include an `account_id` via
 * `NextAuthUserWithAccountId`.
 *
 * Usage note:
 * - Prefer consuming `SessionWithAccountId` in server handlers and helpers that
 *   need access to the numeric `account_id` to avoid repetitive type assertions.
