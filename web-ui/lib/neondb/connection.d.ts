   * Singleton database driver for managing PostgreSQL connections via the Neon serverless driver.
   *
   * This class implements a global singleton pattern to ensure a single database connection pool
   * is shared across the application. It provides both synchronous and asynchronous access to
   * the database connection, with automatic initialization and teardown lifecycle management.
   *
   * **Key Features:**
   * - Global singleton pattern prevents connection pool exhaustion
   * - Lazy initialization - connection established on first use
   * - Automatic cleanup via AfterManager lifecycle hooks
   * - Type-safe query interface via generic type parameter
   * - SSL verification and connection pooling (max 3 connections)
   * - Debug mode enabled for query logging
   *
   * **Lifecycle Management:**
   * The driver automatically registers a teardown handler that:
   * - Closes the connection pool during shutdown
   * - Has a 6-second timeout to prevent hanging
   * - Cleans up the global registry
   *
   * **Usage Patterns:**
   * ```typescript
   * // Asynchronous initialization (recommended)
   * const sql = await pgDbWithInit<User>();
   * const users = await sql`SELECT * FROM users`;
   *
   * // Synchronous access (throws if not initialized)
   * const sql = pgDb<User>();
   * const users = await sql`SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ${id}`;
   * ```
   *
   * @template TQueryRecord - The default record type for database queries
   *
   * @example
   * ```typescript
   * // Type-safe database queries
   * type User = { id: number; email: string; name: string };
   * const db = await pgDbWithInit<User>();
   *
   * // Execute queries with full type safety
   * const users = await db`SELECT * FROM users WHERE active = ${true}`;
   * // users is typed as PostgresRowList<User[]>
   * ```
   *
   * @example
   * ```typescript
   * // Manual teardown (usually automatic)
   * import { PgDbDriver } from '@/lib/neondb/connection';
   * await PgDbDriver.teardown();
   * ```
