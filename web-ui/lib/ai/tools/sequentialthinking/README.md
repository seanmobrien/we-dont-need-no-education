# About this folder: Git subtree integration

This folder is vendored from another repository using git subtree (split of a subdirectory).

- Parent repository (this repo):
  - URL: https://github.com/seanmobrien/we-dont-need-no-education
  - Path to subtree: web-ui/lib/ai/tools/sequentialthinking
- Child (upstream) repository and subdirectory:
  - URL: https://github.com/seanmobrien/mcp-servers
  - Subdirectory: src/sequentialthinking
  - Default branch: develop

Quick operations (from the repository root)
- Pull updates from upstream (only src/sequentialthinking):
  1) Maintain a persistent upstream clone at web-ui/.upstream/mcp-servers
    pwsh
    if (!(Test-Path 'web-ui/.upstream/mcp-servers')) { git clone --depth=1 -b develop https://github.com/seanmobrien/mcp-servers.git 'web-ui/.upstream/mcp-servers' }
    git -C 'web-ui/.upstream/mcp-servers' fetch origin develop
    git -C 'web-ui/.upstream/mcp-servers' checkout develop
    git -C 'web-ui/.upstream/mcp-servers' subtree split --prefix=src/sequentialthinking -b sequentialthinking-split --rejoin
  2) Pull into this subtree (squashed history)
    git subtree pull --prefix=web-ui/lib/ai/tools/sequentialthinking 'web-ui/.upstream/mcp-servers' sequentialthinking-split --squash
  Or use the helper script from anywhere inside the repo:
      pwsh web-ui/scripts/sequentialthinking-subtree-pull.ps1 -Branch develop

- Contribute changes back to upstream:
  1) Commit your edits in this folder as usual in the parent repo
  2) Push a split branch to a fork or to upstream (requires write access)
    pwsh
    # If you don't have push rights, point mcp-servers at your fork first:
    # git remote set-url mcp-servers https://github.com/<your-username>/mcp-servers.git
    git subtree push --prefix=web-ui/lib/ai/tools/sequentialthinking mcp-servers sequentialthinking-split
  # Or use helper script:
  pwsh web-ui/scripts/sequentialthinking-subtree-push.ps1 -Branch sequentialthinking-split -Remote mcp-servers
  3) Open a PR from sequentialthinking-split into the upstream repo
    Note: The split branch places the files at repo root. Upstream maintainers can merge by
    moving those files into src/sequentialthinking (or by using `git subtree merge -P src/sequentialthinking`).

Notes
- Ensure your working tree is clean before running subtree operations.
- We use `--squash` to keep the parent repository history compact.
- A convenience remote named `mcp-servers` is configured to https://github.com/seanmobrien/mcp-servers.git.

### Working on a specific upstream branch ("check out a branch in the sub-repo")

Because this folder is a subtree (not a submodule), it is not an independent Git repo. To work against a specific upstream branch, use a temporary clone of the upstream and then pull/push via subtree.

Check out upstream branch and pull it into the subtree:

1) Use the persistent upstream clone and check out the target branch (replace `<branch>`)
  pwsh
  if (!(Test-Path 'web-ui/.upstream/mcp-servers')) { git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/seanmobrien/mcp-servers.git 'web-ui/.upstream/mcp-servers' }
  git -C 'web-ui/.upstream/mcp-servers' fetch origin <branch>
  git -C 'web-ui/.upstream/mcp-servers' checkout <branch>

2) Split only the desired subdirectory from that branch
  git -C 'web-ui/.upstream/mcp-servers' subtree split --prefix=src/sequentialthinking -b seq-split-<branch>

3) Pull the split branch into this subtree path (squashed)
  git subtree pull --prefix=web-ui/lib/ai/tools/sequentialthinking 'web-ui/.upstream/mcp-servers' seq-split-<branch> --squash

Push local changes to a specific upstream branch:

1) Commit your local edits in this subtree path in the parent repo
2) Push to upstream branch (creates the branch on remote if it doesnâ€™t exist and you have permissions)
  pwsh
  git subtree push --prefix=web-ui/lib/ai/tools/sequentialthinking mcp-servers <branch>

Tip: The persistent local clone lives at `web-ui/.upstream/mcp-servers`. Point subtree commands at that path.

### Helper scripts

Run a pre-flight verification (ensures clean working tree unless -AllowDirty):
  pwsh web-ui/scripts/sequentialthinking-subtree-verify.ps1

One-liner syncs:
- Pull latest from upstream (develop):
  pwsh web-ui/scripts/sequentialthinking-subtree-sync.ps1 -Mode pull -Branch develop
- Pull a feature branch from upstream:
  pwsh web-ui/scripts/sequentialthinking-subtree-sync.ps1 -Mode pull -Branch feature/my-branch
- Push local subtree changes to upstream branch (requires permissions):
  pwsh web-ui/scripts/sequentialthinking-subtree-sync.ps1 -Mode push -Branch sequentialthinking-split -Remote mcp-servers

# Sequential Thinking MCP Server

An MCP server implementation that provides a tool for dynamic and reflective problem-solving through a structured thinking process.

## Features

- Break down complex problems into manageable steps
- Revise and refine thoughts as understanding deepens
- Branch into alternative paths of reasoning
- Adjust the total number of thoughts dynamically
- Generate and verify solution hypotheses

## Tool

### sequential_thinking

Facilitates a detailed, step-by-step thinking process for problem-solving and analysis.

**Inputs:**
- `thought` (string): The current thinking step
- `nextThoughtNeeded` (boolean): Whether another thought step is needed
- `thoughtNumber` (integer): Current thought number
- `totalThoughts` (integer): Estimated total thoughts needed
- `isRevision` (boolean, optional): Whether this revises previous thinking
- `revisesThought` (integer, optional): Which thought is being reconsidered
- `branchFromThought` (integer, optional): Branching point thought number
- `branchId` (string, optional): Branch identifier
- `needsMoreThoughts` (boolean, optional): If more thoughts are needed

## Usage

The Sequential Thinking tool is designed for:
- Breaking down complex problems into steps
- Planning and design with room for revision
- Analysis that might need course correction
- Problems where the full scope might not be clear initially
- Tasks that need to maintain context over multiple steps
- Situations where irrelevant information needs to be filtered out

## Configuration

### Usage with Claude Desktop

Add this to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

#### npx

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sequential-thinking": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

#### docker

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sequentialthinking": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--rm",
        "-i",
        "mcp/sequentialthinking"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

To disable logging of thought information set env var: `DISABLE_THOUGHT_LOGGING` to `true`.

For manual installation, you can configure the MCP server using one of these methods:

**Method 1: User Configuration (Recommended)**
Add the configuration to your user-level MCP configuration file. Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl + Shift + P`) and run `MCP: Open User Configuration`. This will open your user `mcp.json` file where you can add the server configuration.

**Method 2: Workspace Configuration**
Alternatively, you can add the configuration to a file called `.vscode/mcp.json` in your workspace. This will allow you to share the configuration with others.

> For more details about MCP configuration in VS Code, see the [official VS Code MCP documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/mcp).

For NPX installation:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "sequential-thinking": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking"
      ]
    }
  }
