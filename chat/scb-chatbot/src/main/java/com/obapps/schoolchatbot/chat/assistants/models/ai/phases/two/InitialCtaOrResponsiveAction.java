/**
 * Represents an initial call-to-action (CTA) or responsive action in the context of a school chatbot system.
 * This class extends the BasePhaseRecord and provides detailed information about the CTA or response,
 * including its type, inferred status, description, dates, compliance details, reasonability ratings,
 * sentiment, severity, and associated metadata.
 *
 * <p>Key Features:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Tracks whether the item is a notification (ðŸ””) or a message (ðŸ“©).</li>
 *   <li>Includes inferred status, descriptive details, and timestamps for opened and closed dates.</li>
 *   <li>Supports compliance-related fields such as compliance close date and enforceability.</li>
 *   <li>Provides reasonability and sentiment ratings with associated reasons.</li>
 *   <li>Includes metadata such as record ID, document ID, tags, policy basis, and severity details.</li>
 *   <li>Supports closure action items for notifications (ðŸ””).</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Usage:</p>
 * This class is designed to encapsulate all necessary details for managing and evaluating CTAs or responses
 * within the chatbot system. It includes getter and setter methods for accessing and modifying its fields.
 *
 * <p>Fields:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>actionType</b>: Specifies whether the item is a notification (ðŸ””) or a message (ðŸ“©).</li>
 *   <li><b>inferred</b>: Indicates whether the record is implicitly stated or inferred.</li>
 *   <li><b>property_value</b>: A detailed description of the record.</li>
 *   <li><b>openedDate</b>: The date when the event was opened.</li>
 *   <li><b>closedDate</b>: The date when the event was closed.</li>
 *   <li><b>compliancyCloseDate</b>: The compliance close date for the CTA (applicable for ðŸ””).</li>
 *   <li><b>complianceDateEnforceable</b>: Indicates whether the compliance date is enforceable (applicable for ðŸ””).</li>
 *   <li><b>reasonabilityRating</b>: A rating from -10 to 10 describing the reasonability of the request or action.</li>
 *   <li><b>reasonableReason</b>: A list of reasons for the assigned reasonability rating.</li>
 *   <li><b>sentiment</b>: A rating from -1 to 1 describing the sentiment expressed in the request or response.</li>
 *   <li><b>sentimentReasons</b>: A list of reasons for the assigned sentiment rating.</li>
 *   <li><b>closureActionItems</b>: A list of actions required for the record to be considered complete (applicable for ðŸ””).</li>
 *   <li><b>record_id</b>: The unique identifier for this record.</li>
 *   <li><b>document_id</b>: The identifier of the associated document.</li>
 *   <li><b>created_on</b>: The timestamp when this record was created.</li>
 *   <li><b>tags</b>: A list of tags associated with this record.</li>
 *   <li><b>policy_basis</b>: A list of policy bases associated with this record.</li>
 *   <li><b>severity</b>: The severity of the item, rated from 0 to 10.</li>
 *   <li><b>severityReasons</b>: A list of reasons for the assigned severity rating.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Methods:</p>
 * This class provides getter and setter methods for all fields, allowing for easy access and modification.
 * Additionally, it includes a placeholder method for saving the record to a database.
